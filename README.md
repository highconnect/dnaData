# DNA Characteristics

Original work presented in article as below:

DNA has a number of special physical and chemical properties that are important to its structure and functioning. While the terms may sound quite foreign and perhaps even complicated, they are significant to our understanding of DNA and its many applications today.

## Physical Properties
In living organisms such as humans, DNA exists as a pair of molecules rather than a single molecule. These strands are entwined in the shape of a double helix and the helix is kept stable by hydrogen bonds, which can be found between the bases attached to the two strands. A long polymer, DNA is made up of smaller units called nucleotides. In turn, each nucleotide consists of a phosphate group, a sugar and a nitrogenous base. To get a sense of just how long a DNA polymer is, consider that just one human chromosome is several hundred million base pairs long.
