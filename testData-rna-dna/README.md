# DNA Characteristics

### DNA Symmetry
We develop methods to measure and characterize symmetry at multiple orders, and analyze a wide set of genomes, encompassing single- and double-stranded RNA and DNA viruses, bacteria, archae, mitochondria, and eukaryota. We quantify symmetry at orders 1 to 9 for contiguous sequences and pools of coding and non-coding upstream regions, compare the observed symmetry levels to those predicted by simple statistical models, and factor out the effect of lower-order distributions. We establish the universality and variability range of first-order strand symmetry, as well as of its higher-order extensions, and demonstrate the existence of genuine high-order symmetric constraints. We show that ubiquitous reverse-complement symmetry does not result from a single cause, such as point mutation or recombination, but rather emerges from the combined effects of a wide spectrum of mechanisms operating at multiple orders and length scales.
A unified symmetrical theory of DNA sequences has been established based on the basic symmetry of the DNA bases. It is shown that the symmetry of DNA sequences is inherently related to that of a cube and its inscribed regular tetrahedron. A DNA group is defined as a particular alternating group of order 4, in which the permuted objects are four bases. The symmetry of DNA sequences is described by the DNA group which is isomorphic to the tetrahedral group. The matrix representation for the DNA group has been obtained, and used to establish the relationships between the transforms of bases and the rotations of the tetrahedron. It is found that any DNA sequence can be uniquely described by three independent distributions, i.e., the distributions of the bases of purine/pyrimidine, of amino group/keto group and of strong/weak hydrogen bonds along the sequence. The three distributions are invariant in some sense under the transforms of the DNA group, indicating that the three distributions are inherent for the sequence. The mathematical format of the theory lays a foundation for further development. The applications of the theory to analyse some DNA sequences are presented

### DNA Structure 

DNA is made up of molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a phosphate group, a sugar group and a nitrogen base. The four types of nitrogen bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). The order of these bases is what determines DNA's instructions, or genetic code. Similar to the way the order of letters in the alphabet can be used to form a word, the order of nitrogen bases in a DNA sequence forms genes, which in the language of the cell, tells cells how to make proteins. Another type of nucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, or RNA, translates genetic information from DNA into proteins.

The structure is calculated by counting each elements on the DNA structure.

### Base Pairing (match to the next DNA)

Base pairing is a defining property of DNA and was particularly exciting when it was first discovered because it suggested the 'copying' mechanism for DNA. In DNA, bases are specific in that an adenine base, for example, only pairs with a thymine base. Following on that premise, a cytosine base will only bond to a guanine base. This base pairing is also known as complementary base pairing. The concept is quite simplistic but it is significant for DNA.

Here the match pair is calculated by getting (traversing) through the 2 DNA parts and finding all the match elements and representing it either as number or match percentage.

### DNA Grooves

DNA has two kinds of grooves that play important roles in its functioning. Major and minor grooves are structures to allow for necessary proteins in your body to make contact with bases. You might wonder what makes it so important for proteins to attach to the bases. Some of these proteins are called transcription factors. While the word may well be a foreign one for those unfamiliar with DNA - which is most of the public - it is a key one. Transcription factors have numerous roles such as telling your cells how large they should become or suppressing tumour growth. They are also significant for cell development and communication. As such, these DNA grooves seen in the structure of DNA facilitate the binding of proteins like transcription factors, which then serves to keep the cellular processes occurring effectively within your body.

### DNA-RNA total length

Here the total length of the combined DNA-RNA sequence is measured to get an idea about accuracy of the total element.

### Shape and handedness of DNA 

DNA can have a variety of shapes and lengths. Under physiological conditions DNA is found in the so-called B-form, a right-handed double-stranded helix. There is a repeat twist or helix after every 10.4 base pairs or around 34nanometers. The thickness of the DNA is about 2nm and a base pair thickness is about 0.34nm.
In the programming it is set as a flag as 'dna-shape' and is set to 0 by default.

### DNA Replication complexity 

This is also a flag element and is measured as percentage named 'rep-complex'. The complexity indicates the amount of difference in the 2 DNA sequence.

### DNA Supercoiling 

The DNA strands are like a phone cable or a rope. This coiling is a central property of DNA. DNA can be in a relaxed or a coiled state. Coiling helps the extremely long DNA strands to fit into the tiny cell nucleus. Put simply, this supercoiling property makes DNA more efficient packing in more information in small spaces. A non programable element denoted as a flag only.
